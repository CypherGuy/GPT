Liverpool are in discussions with Bayern Munich over Ryan Gravenberch.

As revealed by Sky Sports News, the midfielder was on Jurgen Klopp's midfield shortlist last summer before opting for the Bundesliga team over a switch to Anfield.

Sky Sports News also revealed in April Gravenberch was enthused by the opportunity to steer his development back on track at Liverpool.

The talks with Bayern are to ascertain their valuation of the 21-year-old before a formal offer is submitted if a deal suits all parties. Liverpool are assessing multiple midfield options ahead of the window closing.

The Netherlands international was on a shortlist of options that also featured Aurelien Tchouameni, Enzo Fernandez, Nicolo Barella and the then-unavailable Jude Bellingham for the Premier League club to strengthen their midfield ahead of this season.

Bayern rapidly tied up a deal for Gravenberch from Ajax to beat Liverpool and other European rivals but he has been afforded just 711 minutes of playing time since that transfer, with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka preferred.

Ryan's agent is now Jose Fortes Rodrigues from Raiola. Rafaela Pimenta, who had done work on the player's behalf previously, is no longer part of the Raiola organisation.

So far, there has been no concrete offer, while Gravenberch - who was signed from Ajax last summer for €18m - would be the fourth midfielder Liverpool have recruited this summer.

Bayern are willing to sell the player, who is valued between £30m (€35m) and £34m (€40m). Gravenberch has slipped down to fourth choice in Bayern's centre midfield - after Kimmich, Goretzka and Konrad Laimer.

Sky Germany are reporting Bayern would want to sign replacement first. Talks have been held with Fulham about Joao Palhinha but there has been no offer. Eric Dier is also an option.

Ajax are also understood to have a seven-and-a-half per cent sell-on clause in their agreement with Bayern last summer for Gravenberch.

The German champions batted away January loan approaches for the midfielder, which included one from his former manager Erik ten Hag.

Manchester United then signed Marcel Sabitzer on a temporary deal instead.

Gravenberch has been among United's options in the current window, but they are pressing ahead with a move for Sofyan Amrabat.

Analysis: 'He's a better version of Pogba'

"He has a lot of capabilities, especially in an attacking sense, but he understands hard work,” Ten Hag previously analysed of Gravenberch, and it is a succinct description.

Physically imposing, he is agile, as well as an elite ball carrier and receiver. Having largely operated on the left side of a double pivot, Gravenberch can play across midfield and is very active at link-up in the final third.

A progressive passer that instigates in the build-up phase, he uses his body cleverly to either disguise where he wants to supply the ball or to protect possession.

Gravenberch’s ability to shield, roll his marker and drive into space has been noted by new Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel who highlighted the youngster can “turn and dribble very well”.

Brian Tevreden, who promoted a 12-year-old Gravenberch to the Ajax U15s, believes he has shades of Paul Pogba to his game.

"Physically, I see Frank Rijkaard because he’s tall and very strong. But technically, I would say he's a better version of Pogba in his best days at Juventus, in terms of his technique and his presence on the pitch," Tevreden said. “He's very dominant like Pogba was, and that's what I see in Ryan."

With major tournament experience at international level, impressive Champions League performances, natural leadership qualities and close to a century of senior appearances at his age, it is no surprise that Gravenberch is desperate to return to playing regularly.

Speaking to Ajax Showtime, the Amsterdam native - who became the Eredevisie’s youngest debutant when Ten Hag gave him his breakthrough at 16 - said: “In my career I never really had a setback until this season. I was always a big talent and joined Ajax’s first team at a young age. For me, this season is only the first season in which I’m having a hard time and little game time.

“As a player you also get better from such experiences. I am still very young and I’m glad I’m experiencing something like this now instead of experiencing it for the first time later in my career.

“I’m mentally strong and I’m making even better steps in this situation. This is how I try to convert this experience into something positive. I’m staying strong.

“I’d rather succeed at Bayern. But if that doesn’t work out and I don’t get opportunities, then maybe I should look elsewhere.

“At the moment, however, I’m not so concerned with that and I hope that I can change my situation at Bayern. I’m still convinced in my choice and don’t regret it at all.

“I had certainly hoped and also expected I would play more at Bayern. So far it has not gone as expected. For me that’s a pity, but I’m dealing with it well.”
