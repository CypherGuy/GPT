# NewsSummarizer
A simple program using LangChain that can summarise news articles

When forking a copy, please follow these steps:


1) Head over to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and get a security key. An OpenAI key is needed in order to make requests.
2) Create a file called `constants.py` and add the following line of code into it

APIKEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"

so it looks like this

And that's it, your program is ready to go!

Note: If you want to change the name of the file, change the variable name from constants to your new one in `summarize.py` too
